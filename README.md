# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python (Console Version)

## Overview
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in Python for 2 players. It is a console-based game where players take turns entering a number between 1 and 9 to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after every move and announces the result, whether it's a win, draw, or if the game is still ongoing.

## Features
- **Two-player gameplay**: The game alternates between two players, X and O.
- **Win check**: After every move, the game checks if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a draw.
- **Simple User Interface**: The game uses the terminal or console to display the Tic-Tac-Toe board and prompt users for their moves.
- **Replay option**: After a game ends, you can choose to play again or exit.

## How It Works
1. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid, with each cell numbered 1 to 9.
2. Players take turns entering a number between 1 and 9 to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
3. The game checks for a winner after each move (rows, columns, or diagonals).
4. If there is a winner or the board is full, the game announces the result.
5. Players are asked if they would like to play again after a game ends.
